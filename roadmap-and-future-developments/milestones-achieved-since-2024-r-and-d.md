# Milestones Achieved (Since 2024 R\&D)

Antex's development journey commenced in early 2024, building on the core team's extensive experience in the cryptocurrency space since 2018. This includes hands-on contributions to leading centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Bybit, and OKX, as well as public blockchain projects that emphasized scalability and security. The R\&D phase was driven by a deep analysis of CeFi and DeFi shortcomings—such as centralized custody risks (e.g., the FTX collapse) and performance bottlenecks in traditional DEXs (e.g., Ethereum's high gas fees during peak usage). From the outset, Antex prioritized a security-first, user-centric approach, redesigning core components like consensus and execution engines to create a sovereign L1 blockchain tailored for financial applications.

These milestones reflect a methodical, iterative process: starting with theoretical designs, progressing to prototypes, and culminating in public testing. Key achievements include technical validations, community engagements, and partnerships that have accelerated progress. By late 2024, Antex has achieved over 90% of its initial R\&D targets, with metrics like simulated TPS exceeding expectations and user feedback shaping refinements. This progress not only validates Antex's innovations (e.g., AntBFT consensus and native oracles) but also positions the platform as a resilient alternative to fragmented DeFi ecosystems, fostering trust through open-source contributions and transparent reporting.

* **Q1-Q2 2024: Foundational R\&D and Architecture Design**\
  This initial phase focused on conceptualizing Antex as an independent L1 financial blockchain, addressing the "trilemma" of decentralization, scalability, and security. The team conducted exhaustive reviews of existing models, including HotStuff consensus variants and parallel processing techniques from projects like Solana and Aptos. Key achievements included drafting the technical architecture, which integrated on-chain order books, matching engines, and decentralized oracles at the protocol level—innovations aimed at eliminating off-chain dependencies and reducing manipulation risks.\
  Prototypes for the AntBFT consensus (an optimized HotStuff version with leader rotation enhancements and BLS threshold signatures) were developed, achieving theoretical throughput of 10,000+ TPS in simulations. An internal alpha testnet was deployed, testing basic EVM compatibility and state dependency analysis for parallel execution. Challenges like optimizing for low-latency finality were overcome through iterative simulations, resulting in sub-millisecond confirmation times.\
  **Metrics and Impact**: Over 50 internal tests validated Ethereum-level security, with zero critical failures. This phase secured initial funding (approximately $5M from Web3-aligned investors) and assembled a 20+ member team, including experts from public chains. Community impact began with early whitepaper releases, garnering 2,000+ downloads and feedback that refined user experience priorities, such as seamless cross-chain transfers (e.g., from ETH to Antex). This laid the groundwork for a truly user-owned platform, aligning with Antex's mission to democratize finance.
* **Q3 2024: Core Component Development and Integration**\
  Building on foundational designs, this quarter emphasized implementing and integrating Antex's protocol-level features to create a cohesive ecosystem. The on-chain matching engine was coded and tested for fair, transparent trade executions, while the native decentralized oracle network was built with aggregation from multiple data sources (e.g., mimicking Chainlink but fully on-chain via validator consensus) to ensure manipulation resistance. Cross-chain protocols were prototyped, enabling seamless asset transfers across ETH, BSC, SOL, and TRON without third-party bridges—addressing liquidity fragmentation seen in multi-chain DeFi.\
  EVM compatibility was fully realized, allowing developers to deploy existing smart contracts with minimal modifications, and the Antex Liquidity Pool (ALP) prototype was created as a multi-asset basket (initially with stablecoins like USDT). Security was paramount: initial audits identified and resolved potential vulnerabilities in optimistic execution rollback strategies. Challenges included balancing parallelism with conflict-free processing, resolved through advanced state access list analyses.\
  **Metrics and Impact**: Simulations processed 500,000+ transactions with 99.9% success rates and low slippage (under 0.1% for large orders). This phase attracted 500+ early developers through a preview program, who built and tested dApps like basic perpetual contracts, providing invaluable feedback. Open-sourcing core code on GitHub led to 1,000+ stars and 200+ contributions, fostering a collaborative ecosystem. These integrations enhanced Antex's omnichain vision, reducing cross-chain risks and setting the stage for high-performance trading.
* **Q4 2024: Public Testnet Launch and Initial Testing**\
  The public testnet launch (at [https://testnet.antex.ai](https://testnet.antex.ai/)) marked a pivotal shift from internal development to real-world validation, enabling users to experience Antex's features in a controlled environment. Full support for perpetual contracts (with USDT collateral and long/short positions), spot trading (with professional order types like limit and stop-loss), and ALP liquidity provision was rolled out. The Forced Withdrawal Protocol was integrated for emergency asset recovery, ensuring self-custody even in failure scenarios. Cross-chain functionality was tested live, with successful transfers of assets like ETH and SOL, demonstrating low-latency interoperability.\
  Community beta testing involved over 10,000 participants, who executed millions of transactions and provided feedback via forums and surveys. Stress tests confirmed 5,000+ TPS under load, with millisecond response times rivaling CEXs. Partnerships were formalized, including wallet integrations (e.g., MetaMask) and data providers for oracles, enhancing usability. Challenges like UI glitches were addressed through rapid iterations, incorporating user suggestions for features like social logins.\
  **Metrics and Impact**: Over 1 million simulated trades were processed without exploits, with user satisfaction scores averaging 4.5/5 in feedback. This phase bootstrapped liquidity (e.g., $1M+ in testnet ALP pools) and highlighted Antex's superior experience, such as ultra-low fees (0.02% per trade). It also built momentum for governance, with early Snapshot votes on minor features, reinforcing the user-owned model.
* **Ongoing Achievements (Late 2024 and Beyond)**: As of late 2024, Antex continues to iterate based on testnet data, including refinements to tokenomics (e.g., ANTEX staking simulations yielding 10-15% APY) and governance models (e.g., hybrid DAO prototypes). Educational
