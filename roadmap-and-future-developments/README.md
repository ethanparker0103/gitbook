# Roadmap and Future Developments

Antex's roadmap is a strategic blueprint that outlines the platform's progression from foundational research and development (R\&D) to a fully realized, global decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Rooted in the principles of security, transparency, and user ownership, this roadmap reflects a phased approach to building a sovereign Layer 1 (L1) blockchain optimized for financial applications. Since initiating R\&D in 2024, Antex has prioritized iterative development, community feedback, and partnerships to address real-world challenges in CeFi and DeFi, such as liquidity fragmentation and security risks.

The roadmap is not static; it is governed by the Antex DAO, allowing community proposals to influence timelines and priorities. This ensures adaptability to technological advancements, regulatory shifts, and market dynamics. Key themes include scaling performance (via AntBFT and parallel execution), enhancing interoperability (through native cross-chain protocols), and fostering ecosystem growth (e.g., ALP liquidity pools and dApp integrations). Below, we detail achieved milestones, upcoming phases, and avenues for community involvement and partnerships.

  The public testnet (accessible at [https://testnet.antex.ai](https://testnet.antex.ai/)) went live, featuring full EVM compatibility, USDT-based perpetual and spot trading, and the ALP liquidity pool. Over 10,000 users participated in beta testing, providing feedback on user experience (e.g., millisecond response times and low-slippage trades). Key metrics included 5,000+ TPS in stress tests and successful cross-chain transfers of assets like ETH and SOL. Partnerships with wallet providers (e.g., MetaMask integrations) and oracle data sources were established, enhancing the native oracle's manipulation resistance. This phase also saw the first community-driven improvements, such as UI enhancements based on forum discussions, marking the transition toward decentralized governance.
* **Ongoing Achievements (Late 2024)**: By the end of 2024, Antex achieved key validations, including over 1 million simulated transactions without failures, integration of the Forced Withdrawal Protocol for emergency asset recovery, and initial tokenomics modeling (e.g., ANTEX staking simulations). These milestones have positioned Antex as a promising contender in the DeFi space, with early adopter feedback highlighting its CEX-like performance in a fully decentralized environment.

These accomplishments represent a 100% on-track delivery against initial R\&D goals, with a focus on security-first development. They have mitigated risks like scalability bottlenecks through rigorous testing, setting the stage for broader adoption.

#### Upcoming Phases: Mainnet Launch, Ecosystem Expansion

Looking ahead, Antex's roadmap is divided into three interconnected phases spanning 2025-2027, each building on prior achievements to scale the platform globally. These phases emphasize progressive decentralization, with governance votes determining adjustments (e.g., via the ANTEX DAO). Projected timelines are conservative, accounting for audits, regulatory compliance, and market conditions.

* **Phase 1: Mainnet Launch and Core Stabilization (Q1-Q3 2025)**\
  The mainnet launch, targeted for Q2 2025, will mark Antex's transition from testnet to production, enabling real-world trading with live assets. Preparations include comprehensive security audits (e.g., by firms like Certik or PeckShield) and optimizations for AntBFT to achieve sub-second finality. Key features at launch: full perpetual contracts with up to 100x leverage, spot trading with advanced order types (e.g., limit and stop-loss), and ALP pools seeded with $10M+ in initial liquidity (comprising USDT, BTC, ETH, and other assets). Cross-chain support will expand to include 10+ networks, breaking liquidity silos and enabling seamless transfers. Post-launch, a stabilization period will focus on monitoring network performance, with upgrades like enhanced parallel execution to push TPS toward 50,000. Impact: This phase aims to onboard 100,000+ users, generating initial trading volume and validating Antex's value proposition against competitors like dYdX or GMX.
