# Antex vs. Traditional CEX and DEX

Antex positions itself as a superior hybrid solution that transcends the limitations of traditional centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX), delivering the performance and usability of CEX with the decentralization and transparency of DEX. This comparison highlights how Antex resolves the trilemma of speed, security, and cost, drawing from real-world shortcomings in existing platforms.

Traditional CEX, such as Binance or Coinbase, excel in user experience with high throughput (1,000+ TPS), deep liquidity ($1 billion+ daily volume), and intuitive interfaces for spot and derivatives trading. However, they are inherently centralized, requiring users to deposit assets into custodial wallets, which exposes them to significant risks. The FTX collapse in 2022 is a prime example, where opacity and mismanagement led to $8 billion in lost user funds, with no on-chain verifiability and potential for asset freezes or insider manipulation. Regulatory issues, high withdrawal fees (0.1-1%), and single points of failure (e.g., server outages during market volatility) further undermine trust, making CEX unsuitable for users prioritizing sovereignty.

In contrast, traditional DEX like Uniswap or PancakeSwap offer non-custodial trading and decentralization, allowing users to retain control via wallets. However, they are hampered by performance bottlenecks: low TPS (15-30 on Ethereum), high gas fees ($5-50 per swap during congestion), impermanent loss for liquidity providers (10-20% in volatile pairs), and liquidity fragmentation across chains, resulting in high slippage (5-10% on large orders) and inefficient capital flow ($10 billion+ annual losses from silos). AMM models simplify liquidity but lack advanced order types (e.g., no stop-loss), and reliance on general L1 chains leads to slow confirmations (10-60 seconds) and scalability issues, limiting high-frequency trading.

Antex overcomes these drawbacks with its independent L1 design, combining CEX-like performance (10,000+ TPS, <200ms latencies via parallel execution and AntBFT consensus) and usability (multi-device interfaces with API support) in a fully decentralized, non-custodial framework. It eliminates CEX custodial risks through true self-custody (assets stay in user wallets, verifiable on-chain) and DEX inefficiencies with on-chain order books, native oracles, and ALP for unified liquidity (<0.1% slippage on $10M trades). Fees are ultra-low (<0.01 USD, 80% below Ethereum DEXes), with transparent distribution to stakers and LPs. Quantitative superiority: Antex achieves 99.9% uptime vs. CEX's occasional downtimes and DEX's congestion; security with 33% fault tolerance vs. CEX's single-point failures.

Analogous to a high-speed train that offers the comfort of a car (CEX usability) with the safety of public transport (DEX decentralization), Antex excels in balanced metrics: 9/10 in performance/security/costs vs. CEX's 8/4/7 and DEX's 4/8/5. In a case study, a trader executes a $1M spot trade on Antex with 0.05% slippage and instant confirmation, avoiding CEX custody fears (e.g., FTX lockups) and DEX delays (e.g., Uniswap's 30-second waits), demonstrating Antex's edge for secure, efficient trading across chains.
