# Order Types and Professional Tools

Antex's spot trading is equipped with a diverse array of order types and professional tools, designed to offer traders granular control and advanced functionality within a decentralized framework. Leveraging the on-chain order book and matching engine, these features enable precise execution strategies that rival CeFi platforms like Binance, but with blockchain's transparency and self-custody. Unlike AMM-based DEXes such as Uniswap or Sushiswap, which limit users to basic swaps with no order customization (leading to unpredictable outcomes and high slippage in volatile markets), Antex supports sophisticated types integrated with parallel execution for <100ms fulfillments and 99% fill rates. This empowers users to implement risk-managed trades, with quantitative benefits like reduced execution costs (0.02% fees) and minimal market impact. Analogous to a customizable toolbox where each tool (order type) fits a specific job, these capabilities enhance trading efficiency, supported by ALP for deep liquidity and native oracles for real-time data.

Key order types include:

* **Market Orders**: Immediate execution at the best available price, ideal for quick entries/exits in fast-moving markets (e.g., buying ETH during a dip with <50ms latency).
* **Limit Orders**: Buys/sells only at or better than a specified price, allowing precise positioning (e.g., sell BTC at $35,000 or above to lock profits).
* **Stop-Loss Orders**: Automatic triggers to sell if prices drop below a threshold, mitigating downside risk (e.g., stop-loss on SOL at $140 to limit losses to 5%).
* **Advanced Variants**: Including take-profit (automatic sells at profit targets), OCO (one-cancels-other, pairing stop-loss with take-profit), trailing stops (dynamically adjusting based on price peaks, e.g., trailing 3% below highs), and iceberg orders (hiding large volumes to avoid signaling intent, e.g., gradually selling $1M ETH without moving the market).

Professional tools elevate the experience to institutional levels, accessible via intuitive web/app/API interfaces with features like:

* **API Access**: REST/WebSocket endpoints for algorithmic trading, supporting high-frequency bots with 1ms response times and up to 1,000 requests/second.
* **Advanced Charting**: Real-time graphs with indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) fed by native oracles, customizable for technical analysis.
* **Position Analyzers and Risk Tools**: Dashboards calculating metrics like max drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and exposure, with alerts for margin thresholds.
* **Portfolio Trackers**: Multi-chain overviews integrating spot positions with perpetuals, showing unrealized P/L and historical performance.

In use cases, a day trader uses trailing stops on a BTC position to capture upside while protecting gains during volatility, executing via API for automated strategies. Institutions deploy iceberg orders for large block trades, benefiting from ALP depth to achieve <0.05% slippage on $10M volumesâ€”80% better than AMM DEXes. Tied to AntBFT consensus for verifiable fills and parallel execution for scalability, these tools ensure fair, efficient trading, reducing risks like order sniping (common in opaque CeFi) and empowering users in Antex's ecosystem.
