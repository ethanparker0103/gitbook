# Leverage, Long/Short Positions, and USDT Collateral

Leverage is a key mechanic in Antex's perpetual contracts, allowing users to amplify their market exposure by multiplying their collateral, enabling positions much larger than the initial deposit. Positions are defined as long (betting on price increases) or short (betting on decreases), with size calculated as leverage multiplier \* collateral amount—e.g., $1,000 USDT at 10x leverage opens a $10,000 position in BTC without owning the asset. This contrasts with spot trading, where users buy/sell actual tokens (exposing them to holding risks like hacks), or lower-leverage platforms like Aave (capped at 5x with high fees). Antex supports up to 100x leverage, optimized for high-volatility crypto markets, with dynamic adjustments via the on-chain matching engine to prevent overexposure.

USDT (or USDC) serves as stable collateral, locked in self-custody wallets to back positions, providing stability against crypto volatility (e.g., unlike volatile collateral in some DEXes that amplifies losses). Deposits are simple: users connect an EVM wallet, approve collateral (min $10 for accessibility), and select leverage via intuitive sliders in the app. Long positions profit from rises (e.g., 1% BTC increase yields $100 profit on a $10,000 position), while shorts gain from falls, with funding rates (0.01-0.05% every 8 hours) balancing imbalances—longs pay shorts if overbought, calculated deterministically using native oracle prices. Quantitative risk management includes initial margins (e.g., 1% for 100x) and maintenance margins (0.5%), with automatic liquidations if equity drops below thresholds (e.g., triggering at 80% utilization to prevent negative balances, reducing default risks by 90% vs. manual systems).

Analogous to using a magnifying glass to focus sunlight (amplifying power but requiring careful handling to avoid burns), leverage enhances returns but demands vigilance—Antex mitigates this with real-time oracle feeds for marking prices and position monitoring. In use cases, a retail trader deposits $500 USDT at 20x to short ETH during a bear market, profiting $200 per 1% drop while earning funding fees if shorts are underrepresented. Institutions use cross-margining (pooling collateral across positions) for hedged portfolios, integrated with ALP for liquidity. Tied to AntBFT consensus for instant confirmations (<200ms) and parallel execution for efficient scaling, this mechanic ensures secure, high-leverage trading without owning assets, empowering users in Antex's DeFi ecosystem while minimizing risks through on-chain verifiability and automated safeguards.
