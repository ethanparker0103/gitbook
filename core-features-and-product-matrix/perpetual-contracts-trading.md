# Perpetual Contracts Trading

Antex's perpetual contracts trading feature empowers users to engage in leveraged speculation on asset prices without expiration dates, mirroring futures but with continuous settlement. Built on the on-chain order book and matching engine, it utilizes stablecoin collateral (USDT/USDC) for positions, delivering high-leverage opportunities (up to 100x) with low-latency executions (<200ms) and robust risk controls. This is enabled by the native oracle network for real-time price feeds, ensuring accurate marking, funding rates, and liquidations—addressing common DeFi pitfalls like oracle delays in platforms such as dYdX (causing $50 million+ in unfair liquidations in 2022) or CeFi's custodial risks on Bybit. Unlike expiry-based futures, Antex perpetuals allow indefinite holding, with funding mechanisms balancing long/short imbalances. Analogous to a never-ending race where participants adjust speeds (leverage) in real-time without stopping, this feature supports a $50 billion+ global derivatives market, with Antex providing CEX-like performance (e.g., 10,000+ TPS via parallel execution) in a decentralized, transparent framework. Quantitative highlights include funding rates as low as 0.01% per 8 hours and liquidation thresholds at 0.5% for high leverage, reducing default risks by 90% through oracle precision. Integrated with AntBFT consensus for deterministic finality, it ensures verifiable trades, fostering trust for retail and institutional users alike.

**Leverage, Long/Short Positions, and USDT Collateral**

Leverage in Antex perpetuals amplifies exposure, allowing users to control large positions with minimal capital—e.g., 100x leverage turns $100 USDT collateral into a $10,000 BTC position. Long positions bet on price increases (profiting from rises), while short positions profit from declines, with no need to hold the underlying asset. Collateral is locked in USDT/USDC (minimum $10 for accessibility), providing stability against volatility; positions are marked-to-market using oracle prices, with automatic adjustments for funding rates (paid/received every 8 hours to incentivize balance). For example, a trader deposits $1,000 USDT at 20x leverage to long ETH, profiting $200 per 1% price rise, with real-time monitoring via the app.

Risk management is robust: maintenance margins (e.g., 0.5-1% for high leverage) trigger partial or full liquidations if equity drops, executed on-chain via the matching engine to prevent negative balances. This contrasts with platforms like Perpetual Protocol (AMM-based with higher slippage) or Binance Futures (custodial with freeze risks), where Antex's integration reduces liquidation delays to <100ms and eliminates custody issues through self-custody wallets. Quantitative edges include isolated margin modes (limiting risk to single positions) and cross-margin (pooling collateral), with success rates >99% in stress tests. In use cases, a hedge fund shorts SOL during bear markets using 50x leverage, earning funding fees (up to 0.05% hourly in imbalanced markets), while retail users scale in with low collateral for passive strategies. Tied to the native oracle for tamper-resistant prices and ALP for liquidity, this sub-feature ensures fair, efficient trading, minimizing losses from manipulation and enhancing Antex's appeal as a comprehensive DeFi platform.
