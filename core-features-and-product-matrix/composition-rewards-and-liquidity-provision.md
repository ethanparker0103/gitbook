# Composition, Rewards, and Liquidity Provision

ALP's composition is designed as a dynamic, index-like basket of assets, providing a balanced and diversified liquidity reservoir that evolves with market needs and community governance. Initially focused on stablecoins (e.g., 70% allocation to USDT/USDC for low-volatility anchoring), the pool expands in phases to include blue-chip cryptocurrencies like BTC (20%), ETH (5%), SOL (3%), and others (2%), creating a multi-asset index that mirrors diversified investment funds. This structure is maintained through on-chain governance votes by ANTEX holders, with automatic rebalancing triggered by native oracle data (e.g., quarterly adjustments based on market cap and TVL to keep ratios optimal). Unlike single-pair AMM pools in Uniswap or Balancer, which are prone to concentration risks (e.g., the 2022 UST depeg causing $40 billion in losses across Terra-linked pools), ALP's diversified composition spreads exposure, reducing impermanent loss by 60-80% through stablecoin weighting and algorithmic hedging. Quantitative metrics include a target TVL of $1 billion+ within the first year, with composition transparency ensured via the Data Layer for real-time audits.

Rewards are distributed to LPs as a share of platform trading fees (e.g., 0.03% from spot trades and 0.05% from perpetuals), providing a passive income stream that incentivizes long-term participation. LPs earn proportionally to their pool share, with yields ranging from 8-15% APY in standard conditions and up to 25% during high-volume periods (compounded daily via smart contracts integrated with the Contract Layer). Bonus mechanisms, such as 10% extra rewards for 30-day locks or market-making contributions, further boost returns, outperforming basic staking (e.g., 5-10% on Ethereum) by tying earnings to actual platform activity. Slashing for malicious actions (e.g., sudden withdrawals during stress, penalized at 5-10% of shares) ensures stability, tied to PoS validators. Analogous to a cooperative farm where contributors share harvests based on input, this model democratizes rewards, with governance allowing LPs to vote on fee splits (e.g., 40% to LPs, 30% to stakers, 30% to treasury).

Liquidity provision is straightforward and accessible, requiring users to connect an EVM wallet (e.g., MetaMask), select assets from supported chains (via multi-chain integration), and deposit (minimum $100 equivalent) to receive fungible ALP tokens representing shares. Deposits are processed through the matching engine for instant integration, with parallel execution handling multiple provisions concurrently (<200ms). Withdrawals are permissionless, with no lockups (unlike veCRV's 4-year vesting), though optional locks yield bonuses. In use cases, a retail user deposits $1,000 in USDT/ETH to earn 12% APY from perpetual volumes, diversifying risks across the basket, while an institution provides $5 million in BTC for market-making rewards, enhancing overall depth. Tied to the native oracle for accurate valuations and AntBFT for secure settlements, this process supports ALP's role in reducing slippage (<0.1% on large trades), making liquidity provision a low-barrier, high-reward entry point to Antex's ecosystem.
