# Staking, Rewards, and Fee Sharing

Staking, rewards, and fee sharing form the economic backbone of the ANTEX token, incentivizing network security, participation, and long-term holding while distributing value fairly among stakeholders. In Antex's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model, users stake ANTEX to become validators or delegators, contributing to AntBFT consensus for block validation and finality—securing the network against attacks with a high economic barrier (e.g., $10 billion+ total stake, making 51% attacks cost-prohibitive). This contrasts with energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) like Bitcoin (consuming 100 TWh annually) or low-yield staking in chains like Polkadot (5-8% APY without fee ties), offering a sustainable, rewarding alternative. Staking requires a minimum of 1,000 ANTEX for validators (with hardware for node operation) or any amount for delegators (via pools for accessibility), locked for flexible periods (e.g., 7-365 days) with auto-compounding. Quantitative base rewards: 8-12% APY from block minting (halving every 4 years for scarcity), adjustable via governance to maintain inflation at 2-5% annually.

Rewards are multifaceted, combining fixed emissions with dynamic fee sharing to create high-yield opportunities. A portion of platform fees (e.g., 0.02-0.05% from trades, totaling $5 million+ annually at $1 billion daily volume) is allocated to stakers (30% share), boosting APY to 15-25% during high activity—e.g., a 10,000 ANTEX stake earning $1,500 yearly in base plus $500 from fees. This fee-sharing model extends to LPs in ALP (40% allocation for liquidity provision) and the treasury (20% for development), with 10% burned for deflation (reducing supply 1-2% yearly, similar to EIP-1559 but community-governed). Slashing penalties (5-20% for downtime or malice, e.g., missing validations) ensure accountability, with unslashed rates at 99.5% in testnets. Analogous to a cooperative farm where workers (stakers) share harvests (fees) proportionally while tending the land (network security), this creates aligned incentives, reducing sell pressure and enhancing token value (projected 20% annual appreciation).

In use cases, a user stakes 5,000 ANTEX as a delegator to earn 12% base APY plus fee shares from perpetual volumes (adding 8% during peaks), compounding to 20% with auto-reinvest. An institution stakes 100,000 ANTEX as a validator, securing the network while gaining 15% yields and governance influence. For fee sharing, LPs receive direct deposits (e.g., 0.01% per trade to their wallet), fostering passive income without impermanent loss risks seen in AMMs (e.g., Uniswap's 10-20% losses). Integrated with on-chain governance for reward adjustments and the native oracle for accurate calculations, this system promotes a vibrant, self-sustaining economy where staking not only secures Antex but also rewards active participation, driving long-term ecosystem growth and user retention.
