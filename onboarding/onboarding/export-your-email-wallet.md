# Export your email wallet

As a reminder, the Hyperliquid bridge contract only accepts Arbitrum USDC sent over Arbitrum. If you accidentally send the wrong asset to your defi wallet:

1. Make sure you are logged in with the same email address
2. Click "Export Email Wallet" in the settings dropdown in the navigation bar
3. Follow the steps in the pop-up to copy your private key
4. Import your private key into the wallet extension of your choice
