# How to stake HYPE

You can use different websites to stake HYPE on HyperCore, including:

* [https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/staking/](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/staking/)
* [https://stake.nansen.ai/stake/hyperliquid](https://stake.nansen.ai/stake/hyperliquid)
* [https://app.validao.xyz/stake/hyperliquid](https://app.validao.xyz/stake/hyperliquid)
* [https://hypurrscan.io/staking](https://hypurrscan.io/staking)

1. You will need HYPE in your Spot Balance on HyperCore. If you have HYPE on the HyperEVM, you would need to [transfer it from the HyperEVM](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/onboarding/how-to-use-the-hyperevm#how-do-i-move-assets-to-and-from-the-hyperevm) to HyperCore.
2. Transfer HYPE from your Spot Balance to your Staking Balance.

3. Choose a validator to stake to. Staking to a validator has a 1 day lockup.

To unstake, follow the same process in reverse

1. Unstake from a validator.
2. Transfer from your Staking Balance to your Spot Balance. This takes 7 days.
3. After 7 days, the HYPE will appear in your Spot Balance.

For further questions, you can refer to the Staking section.
