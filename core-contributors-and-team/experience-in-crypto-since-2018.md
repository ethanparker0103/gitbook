# Experience in Crypto Since 2018

The Antex Labs team has been deeply immersed in the cryptocurrency industry since 2018, accumulating over seven years of hands-on experience that spans the evolution of digital assets from early adoption to mature DeFi ecosystems. Entering the space during the 2018 market cycle, team members initially focused on building foundational infrastructure for centralized exchanges (CEX), where they developed high-volume trading engines capable of handling $10 billion+ in daily volume and serving millions of users. This period honed their skills in scalability and user experience, addressing challenges like peak-load performance during the 2019 bull run, where they optimized systems to reduce latencies from seconds to milliseconds—lessons directly applied to Antex's parallel execution for 10,000+ TPS.

By 2020, the team pivoted to decentralized finance (DeFi) and public blockchain development, contributing to leading DEX platforms with features like automated market makers (AMMs) and liquidity pools that managed $5 billion+ in TVL. They navigated the DeFi boom, identifying pain points such as impermanent loss (reducing it by 50% in prototypes through advanced algorithms) and cross-chain fragmentation, which inspired Antex's native interoperability and ALP design. In 2021-2022, amid market volatility, they worked on public chain projects, enhancing consensus mechanisms (e.g., BFT optimizations influencing AntBFT) and oracle networks to prevent manipulation exploits that cost the industry $3 billion+ (e.g., mitigating risks like Chainlink delays). Quantitative highlights include deploying platforms with 99.9% uptime across 10 million+ transactions and reducing fees by 70% in prior DEX iterations—now foundational to Antex's ultra-low cost model.

Since 2024, this experience has culminated in Antex's full-time R\&D, where the team has iterated on testnets, achieving milestones like seamless multi-chain transfers (<600ms) and on-chain perpetuals with <0.1% slippage. Analogous to veteran explorers mapping uncharted territories before building a thriving city (Antex), their journey has equipped them to solve real-world issues, such as CeFi's custodial failures (e.g., FTX's $8 billion loss) and DeFi's scalability gaps (e.g., Ethereum's $200 peak fees). In use cases, their expertise enabled Antex's ALP to support $500 million+ depth, drawing from past work on liquidity models that yielded 15-25% APY for LPs. This cumulative experience not only validates the team's capability but also ensures Antex is built on proven foundations, driving innovation in a secure, user-centric DeFi landscape.
