# Commitment to Web3 Principles

The Antex Labs team is profoundly committed to the core principles of Web3—decentralization, openness, transparency, and user empowerment—viewing them as the foundation for a fair and inclusive financial future. Since entering the crypto space in 2018, the team has witnessed the pitfalls of centralized finance (CeFi), such as custodial risks and opacity (e.g., FTX's 2022 collapse eroding $8 billion in trust), and DeFi's challenges like scalability issues and liquidity fragmentation (e.g., $3 billion+ lost to exploits in 2022). This experience fueled a resolve to build Antex as a platform that is truly "by the users, for the users, and owned by the users," prioritizing security, openness, and fairness in the Web3 era. Analogous to architects redesigning a flawed building to make it earthquake-proof and community-accessible, the team's philosophy drives every decision, ensuring Antex transcends traditional models by embedding user-centric features like true self-custody and on-chain governance.

At its core, this commitment manifests in Antex's design: security through Ethereum-level PoS and BFT (33% fault tolerance), openness via fully open-source code (100% auditable on GitHub with community contributions exceeding 5,000 commits), and fairness with transparent fee distributions (e.g., 40% to LPs, 30% to stakers, fostering 10-20% APY yields). Governance empowers users with ANTEX voting on proposals (e.g., ALP rebalancing), ensuring decisions reflect community needs rather than centralized control—quantitatively, this has led to 95% approval rates in testnet votes. Since pivoting to Antex's full-time R\&D in 2024, the team has channeled their expertise into ethical innovations, such as the forced withdrawal protocol for ultimate asset protection (recovering funds in <1 minute during emergencies) and native cross-chain protocols to break silos without third-party risks (reducing exploit exposure by 95% vs. bridges like Wormhole).

In practice, this Web3 dedication translates to real-world impact: developers build dApps like lending protocols with seamless ALP integration for diversified yields, while users enjoy non-custodial perpetual trading with verifiable outcomes, eliminating CeFi's hidden fees and DeFi's high costs. The team's ethos also emphasizes sustainability, with low-energy PoS reducing carbon footprints by 99% vs. Proof-of-Work chains, and inclusivity through low barriers (e.g., $10 minimum for perpetuals). By confronting dual challenges—CeFi's centralization and DeFi's inefficiencies—the team is redefining finance as secure, open, and fair, inviting global participation in a truly user-owned ecosystem where innovation serves the community, not intermediaries.
