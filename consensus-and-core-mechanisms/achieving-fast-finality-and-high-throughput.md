# Achieving Fast Finality and High Throughput

AntBFT excels in delivering fast, deterministic finality and exceptional throughput, critical for Antex's financial L1 where transaction irreversibility must be achieved in real-time to support high-stakes DeFi activities. Unlike probabilistic consensuses in chains like Ethereum (where finality can take 6-12 minutes with risks of reorgs) or Solana (which achieves sub-second times but has faced outages under extreme load), AntBFT provides guaranteed finality in milliseconds through targeted optimizations. This ensures "instant" confirmation of trades, enhancing availability and user trust—essential for scenarios like perpetual contract liquidations, where delays could lead to cascading financial losses. By integrating these features with Antex's parallel execution, AntBFT enables the network to process tens of thousands of transactions per second (TPS), positioning Antex as a scalable alternative to centralized exchanges without their opacity.

At the core is an optimized two-stage commit process (prepare and commit phases), refined with a two-chain commit rule. In the prepare phase, validators vote on a proposal, forming a "prepare chain" of quorum certificates. The commit phase then builds a secondary "commit chain" by linking two consecutive prepare certificates, confirming finality once a threshold (e.g., 2/3 quorum) is met. This dual-chain structure allows overlapping rounds, pipelining proposals without full synchronization waits, which reduces latency in partially synchronous networks (where messages may delay up to a known bound). Quantitatively, this achieves finality in 200-500ms—up to 100x faster than Ethereum's slots—while maintaining liveness even if one-third of nodes are faulty. Simulations demonstrate 99.9% uptime in high-latency tests, far surpassing base HotStuff's performance by 30-50% through Antex-specific tweaks like adaptive chaining thresholds.

This is analogous to a high-speed assembly line where parts (proposals) move continuously without stopping for every inspection, ensuring rapid output (final blocks). In DeFi use cases, such as on-chain matching for spot trades or oracle price updates during market volatility, AntBFT's fast finality prevents disputes over transaction order, enabling seamless execution of 10,000+ TPS. For instance, a user opening a leveraged BTC/USDT position can receive confirmation almost instantly, supporting high-frequency trading that rivals CeFi platforms like Binance but with blockchain verifiability.

High throughput is amplified by AntBFT's synergy with parallel execution: while consensus finalizes blocks, the engine processes non-conflicting transactions concurrently, scaling to 20,000-50,000 TPS in optimized setups. This outperforms probabilistic models like Avalanche (prone to temporary forks) by providing deterministic guarantees, crucial for Antex's native oracles and liquidity pools. Overall, these enhancements deliver unparalleled availability, making AntBFT the engine for a resilient, high-performance DeFi ecosystem where speed and certainty drive user adoption and innovation.
