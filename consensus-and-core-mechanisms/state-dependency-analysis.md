# State Dependency Analysis

State dependency analysis is the foundational step in Antex's parallel execution engine, a proactive mechanism that occurs as transactions enter the mempoolâ€”the temporary holding area before block inclusion. This process involves scanning each transaction to create a State Access List, a concise summary of the blockchain state elements it interacts with, including read sets (data it queries, like account balances) and write sets (data it modifies, such as token transfers or contract storage updates). By identifying these dependencies upfront, the engine can classify transactions into groups that can be executed in parallel without risking conflicts, such as race conditions where two operations attempt to modify the same state simultaneously.

The analysis is performed efficiently in near-constant time (O(1) per transaction) using static code inspection and dependency graphing techniques, leveraging the transaction's bytecode and known contract interfaces. For instance, a simple USDT transfer might list reads from the sender's balance and writes to the recipient's, while a complex perpetual contract order could involve multiple contract calls. This pre-processing happens before consensus via AntBFT, ensuring only analyzable transactions advance, which enhances security by filtering out malformed or malicious inputs early. Analogous to a librarian cataloging books before shelving them, this step organizes transactions for optimal retrieval and processing, preventing the chaos of unindexed chaos.

Compared to sequential execution in traditional EVM-based chains like Ethereum, where all transactions are processed one-by-one regardless of independence (leading to idle CPU time and low TPS of 15-30), Antex's analysis enables 5-10x efficiency gains by grouping non-dependent transactions. Quantitative benchmarks show it processes 1,000+ transactions in under 100ms on standard hardware, reducing overall block execution time by 50-70%. In DeFi use cases, this shines during high-volume scenarios: for example, analyzing a batch of spot trades (e.g., BTC/USDT) and unrelated oracle price updates allows them to be flagged as independent, enabling concurrent execution without conflicts. This supports Antex's on-chain matching engine, ensuring low slippage in ALP liquidity pools and fast confirmations for perpetual contracts.

By minimizing conflicts and optimizing scheduling, state dependency analysis directly contributes to Antex's scalability, lowering gas fees to fractions of a cent and fostering a high-throughput environment. It integrates seamlessly with optimistic execution strategies, providing the data needed for quick rollbacks if needed, ultimately empowering a secure, efficient DeFi platform where performance meets reliability.
