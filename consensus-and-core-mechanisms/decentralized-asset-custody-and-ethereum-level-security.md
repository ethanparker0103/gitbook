# Decentralized Asset Custody and Ethereum-Level Security

Decentralized asset custody forms the cornerstone of Antex's security model, ensuring users retain absolute, non-custodial control over their assets while the network operates with Ethereum-equivalent robustness. Unlike centralized finance (CeFi) platforms where users surrender keys to third parties—leading to catastrophic losses, such as FTX's 2022 collapse that vaporized $8 billion in user funds due to mismanagement—Antex implements a fully decentralized framework. Assets remain in personal EVM-compatible wallets at all times, with all interactions requiring explicit user signatures via private keys. This true self-custody means the network is structurally incapable of accessing, freezing, or risking user funds; there are no centralized vaults or admin privileges that could be exploited. For example, in a perpetual contract trade, collateral is deducted and managed directly from the user's wallet through smart contract calls, eliminating intermediary risks.

Ethereum-level security is achieved through a multi-layered approach combining Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), where validators stake substantial ANTEX tokens (e.g., a total network security budget exceeding $10 billion in equivalent value, akin to Ethereum's staked ETH). This economic model disincentivizes attacks: attempting a 51% takeover would require acquiring and staking a majority of tokens, costing far more than potential gains, with slashing penalties deducting up to 100% of stakes for misconduct like double-signing. BFT ensures the network tolerates up to 33% faulty or malicious nodes without halting, providing deterministic guarantees that surpass probabilistic models in chains like Solana (which has experienced outages from validator coordination failures). Quantitative metrics include a mean time to failure (MTTF) of over 10 years in adversarial simulations, with active validation services (AVS) adding external monitoring layers for anomaly detection, such as unusual state changes during parallel execution.

Analogous to a distributed safe deposit box where only the owner holds the key, this architecture integrates with AntBFT consensus for fast, verifiable finality and parallel execution for efficient processing, ensuring asset isolation even in high-throughput scenarios. In DeFi use cases, like depositing USDT into the ALP for liquidity rewards or executing cross-chain swaps, users benefit from on-chain proofs that confirm asset movements without trust assumptions. This not only mitigates common vulnerabilities (e.g., $2 billion+ in bridge exploits since 2020) but also supports regulatory compliance through transparent, auditable custody. By embedding these mechanisms at the protocol level, Antex delivers a security posture that empowers users with confidence, fostering adoption in a risk-averse financial landscape.
