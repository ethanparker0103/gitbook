# Optimistic Execution and Rollback Strategies

To handle transactions with potential dependencies that aren't fully resolved during state analysis, Antex's parallel execution engine employs optimistic execution strategies, assuming no conflicts initially and proceeding with parallel processing across multiple cores. This approach is particularly useful for complex DeFi workloads where dependencies might emerge dynamically, such as in multi-step smart contract calls. By executing optimistically, the engine creates lightweight checkpoints (e.g., temporary state snapshots) at key points, allowing provisional results to be computed without immediate serialization. If no conflicts arise, the executions commit seamlessly; however, upon detecting issues (e.g., two transactions attempting to write to the same account balance), the system initiates a rapid rollback and reordering process to resolve them deterministically.

Rollback is designed for minimal overhead: affected transactions are reverted in under 1ms using efficient state restoration from checkpoints, followed by re-execution in a safe order (e.g., prioritizing the transaction with the earliest timestamp). This reordering leverages the dependency graphs from prior analysis, ensuring quick resolution without halting the entire block. Quantitatively, optimistic strategies allow 80-90% of potentially conflicting transactions to complete without intervention in typical loads, boosting overall throughput to 10,000-50,000 TPSâ€”far exceeding pessimistic models that serialize everything upfront (e.g., in traditional databases or EVM variants, which cap at 100-500 TPS due to conservative locking). It's analogous to drivers proceeding through a green light assuming clear roads, with instant brakes and rerouting if an obstacle appears, minimizing delays while maximizing flow.

In DeFi contexts, this enables robust handling of intricate scenarios: for example, during a flash loan sequence involving leveraged perpetual contracts and cross-chain swaps, the engine optimistically parallelizes non-obvious independent steps (e.g., oracle queries and collateral checks), rolling back only if a shared state conflict (like overlapping liquidity pool updates) is detected. This supports Antex's on-chain matching engine, ensuring low-latency settlements in volatile markets without impermanent loss risks seen in AMM-based DEXes. Compared to fully sequential systems like Bitcoin, which process one transaction at a time, Antex's method harnesses multi-core CPUs for 5-10x efficiency gains, reducing energy use and fees while maintaining blockchain determinism.

These strategies maximize computational power, aligning with AntBFT's fast finality to support a global financial market. By balancing optimism with safe rollbacks, Antex delivers scalable, reliable DeFi, where high TPS empowers users with seamless, cost-effective trading experiences.
