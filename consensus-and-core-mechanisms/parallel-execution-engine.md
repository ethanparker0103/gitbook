# Parallel Execution Engine

Traditional blockchain execution models, such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)'s sequential processing, create inherent bottlenecks by handling transactions one-by-one, limiting throughput to 15-30 TPS and causing high latency during network peaks. Antex's parallel execution engine overcomes this by leveraging advanced parallel computing techniques, allowing logically independent transactions to be classified, scheduled, and executed simultaneously across multiple computational cores. This innovation is tightly integrated with AntBFT consensus, enabling Antex to achieve theoretical throughput of 10,000+ TPS—rivaling centralized databases while preserving blockchain's determinism and security. In DeFi contexts, this means processing complex operations like simultaneous perpetual contract adjustments and spot trades without delays, supporting high-frequency trading and reducing gas costs by up to 80% compared to sequential systems. The engine operates in the execution layer, post-consensus, ensuring that validated transactions are finalized efficiently. Analogous to a multi-lane highway distributing traffic for faster flow, it maximizes hardware utilization (e.g., multi-core CPUs or GPUs), making Antex scalable for global adoption. The following subsections detail the key components that drive this performance.

**State Dependency Analysis**

The foundation of parallel execution begins with state dependency analysis, a proactive process that occurs as transactions enter the mempool (the pre-block staging area). Each transaction is scanned to generate a State Access List—a compact summary of the state elements it reads from or writes to, such as account balances, contract storage, or token holdings. This analysis is performed efficiently in near-constant time (O(1) per transaction) using static code inspection and dependency graphing, identifying potential conflicts before execution.

For example, if Transaction A modifies a USDT balance for User X and Transaction B updates an unrelated ETH perpetual position for User Y, the analysis flags them as independent. This contrasts with EVM's blind sequential approach, where all transactions wait in line, leading to idle CPU resources. In Antex, this step enables intelligent scheduling, preventing race conditions while optimizing for DeFi workloads—like analyzing 1,000+ trades in under 100ms during a market event. Quantitatively, it reduces overall execution time by 50-70% by grouping non-dependent transactions, directly contributing to Antex's high TPS and low fees (e.g., <0.01 USD per trade). This analysis also integrates with AntBFT's mempool management, ensuring only valid, non-malicious transactions proceed, enhancing network security.

**Conflict-Free Concurrent Processing**

Once dependencies are mapped, the engine schedules conflict-free transactions for concurrent processing across available computational resources, such as multiple CPU cores or threads. Transactions without overlapping state accesses (e.g., no shared accounts or contracts) are dispatched to separate execution units, running in parallel without synchronization locks. This conflict-free model maximizes efficiency: on a 64-core system, up to 64 independent transactions could execute simultaneously, slashing block processing time from seconds to milliseconds.

In a DeFi scenario, this enables handling diverse operations like a batch of spot trades on different pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT and SOL/USDC) alongside unrelated oracle updates, all without interference. Compared to sequential models in chains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which process one transaction at a time (leading to bottlenecks during congestion), Antex's approach boosts throughput by 10-20x, achieving 5,000-10,000 TPS in benchmarks. It's like assigning tasks to a team of workers rather than a single person—distributing load to avoid queues. This not only improves scalability but also reduces energy consumption, as idle cores are minimized, aligning with Antex's sustainable PoS design. For users, it means faster confirmations for high-volume activities, such as ALP liquidity provisions during yield farming spikes.

**Optimistic Execution and Rollback Strategies**

For transactions with potential dependencies that aren't immediately clear, Antex employs an optimistic execution strategy: assuming no conflicts initially and proceeding with parallel processing, while maintaining lightweight checkpoints (e.g., state snapshots) for rapid detection and resolution. If a conflict is detected mid-execution (e.g., two trades attempting to modify the same account balance), the engine triggers a fast rollback—reverting affected states in under 1ms using efficient reordering algorithms—and reschedules the transactions serially or in a non-conflicting manner.

This optimism minimizes unnecessary conservatism, allowing 80-90% of transactions to complete without intervention in typical DeFi workloads, inspired by database techniques like those in PostgreSQL. Rollbacks are rare and low-cost, with re-execution optimized via dependency graphs from the analysis phase. For instance, during a flash loan sequence involving multiple contract calls, the engine can optimistically parallelize non-dependent steps, rolling back only if an unexpected overlap occurs—ensuring determinism without halting the network. Compared to pessimistic models that serialize everything (e.g., in traditional EVM), this boosts efficiency by 4-8x, supporting Antex's goal of millisecond-level finality. In practice, it enables seamless handling of complex scenarios like cross-chain asset swaps or batch liquidations, with recovery times negligible compared to network latency.

Together, these components make the parallel execution engine a powerhouse for Antex, synergizing with AntBFT to deliver scalable, efficient DeFi without sacrificing security or verifiability.
