# Social Login Options

For faster onboarding without managing mnemonics, Antex offers social login options via trusted providers like Google, Twitter, or Apple, which generate an EVM-compatible address linked to your account. This method abstracts key management while preserving self-custody—your assets are still controlled by you, with the social provider only handling authentication (secured by OAuth and 2FA). It's perfect for beginners, reducing setup time to <1 minute (vs. 5-10 minutes for manual wallets) and ideal for mobile users. To use: On the testnet site, click "Connect with Social," select your provider, authorize the login (e.g., via Google account), and confirm—Antex creates a secure address automatically.

Once logged in, the experience is identical to wallet users: deposit assets, trade, and withdraw. In use cases, a casual trader logs in via Twitter to quickly buy ETH on spot with test USDT, executing in <200ms. However, for high-value trading, pair with a hardware wallet for extra security, as social accounts can be phishing targets (causing $1 billion+ annual losses industry-wide). Tip: Enable strong passwords and 2FA on social accounts; treat this as a convenient entry, not a substitute for secure wallet practices.

After connecting, explore the dashboard to deposit, trade, and monitor—Antex's intuitive interface and low fees make starting easy. If issues arise, check the community forums or support for guidance. Remember, security is paramount: never share login details or phrases.
