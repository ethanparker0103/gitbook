# Withdrawing USDT and Other Assets

Withdrawing assets from AnteX is a secure, user-controlled process that maintains your self-custody, allowing you to transfer USDT or other supported tokens back to your wallet or another chain without platform interference. This non-custodial approach means AnteX never holds your funds—withdrawals are direct, gas-free on the AnteX side, and processed via native cross-chain protocols for seamless exits. Unlike CeFi platforms (e.g., Binance, where withdrawals can incur high fees of 0.1-1% and delays during volatility, plus custody risks), or DEXes with complex unwrapping (e.g., Uniswap's LP token redemptions with impermanent loss calculations taking minutes), AnteX enables instant, fee-minimal withdrawals in <1 minute. Integrated with AntBFT consensus for verifiable finality and parallel execution for efficiency, this feature supports high-volume exits (up to 500 TPS) with 99.9% success rates. Analogous to safely retrieving items from a personal locker using your own key, without staff involvement, it reinforces AnteX's commitment to user sovereignty. Quantitative benefits: zero gas on AnteX for the withdrawal transaction (source chain gas may apply, <0.01 USD on L2s), reducing costs by 90% vs. traditional methods. Always verify the destination address to avoid errors, and use testnet for practice. The following steps guide you through the process, with tips for safe management.

1. **Navigate to Withdrawal Page**: From the AnteX dashboard (e.g., [https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future/BTCUSDT](https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future/BTCUSDT) for BTCUSDT pair, or general wallet section), click "Withdraw" or select from the menu. This works for USDT and other assets like ETH, SOL, or ALP shares.
2. **Select Asset and Amount**: Choose the asset (e.g., USDT) and network for withdrawal (e.g., back to Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, or TRON). Enter the amount (no minimum on testnet; mainnet may have $10 min for anti-dust). The system displays your balance and estimated arrival time.
3. **Choose Destination**: Input your wallet address on the target chain—AnteX's native protocols handle the cross-chain transfer securely, with atomic execution (all or nothing to prevent partial losses).
4. **Confirm and Execute**: Review details (e.g., no gas on AnteX, source chain fees if applicable), then click "Withdraw." Sign the transaction in your wallet popup—it's gas-free on AnteX, completing in 300-600ms via consensus validation.
5. **Monitor and Verify**: Track the status in the dashboard or block explorer; funds arrive in your wallet, verifiable on-chain. For other assets (e.g., withdrawing ETH from a spot position), the process is similar, with ALP redemptions converting shares back to underlying tokens.

In use cases, after profiting from a perpetual short on ETH, withdraw $2,000 USDT to Solana for staking elsewhere, completing in <1 minute without fees eating into gains. An institution pulls $1 million from ALP post-liquidity provision, transferring to BNB Chain for cross-ecosystem use. Tip: Use the forced withdrawal protocol in emergencies (bypass frontend via direct on-chain call) for ultimate safety; double-check addresses (use copy-paste, not manual entry) to avoid irreversible losses (a common error costing $100 million+ annually). Common mistake: Withdrawing during high source-chain congestion—check gas prices and use L2s like Arbitrum for cheaper, faster exits. With AnteX's multi-chain support, withdrawals are flexible and secure, ensuring you retain control and can exit anytime. For issues, consult the FAQ or community support.
