# Best Practices for Security (Mnemonic Phrases, Private Keys)

Security is paramount in DeFi, where you are your own bank—AnteX's non-custodial design means your assets are safe only if you protect your wallet credentials. The mnemonic phrase (recovery seed, typically 12-24 words) and private keys are the keys to your kingdom: anyone with access can control your funds, leading to irreversible losses (e.g., $1 billion+ stolen annually from phrase compromises). Unlike CeFi platforms with account recovery (but custody risks), AnteX emphasizes self-responsibility, integrated with features like forced withdrawals for emergencies. Follow these best practices to safeguard your assets, reducing hack risks by 95% (per industry reports). Analogous to locking a safe with a unique combination only you know, treat these as irreplaceable—mishandling is a common mistake causing 20-30% of crypto losses. Quantitative tip: Use tools with 99.9% uptime ratings and enable multi-factor protections.

1. **Never Share Your Mnemonic Phrase or Private Keys**: Your phrase is the master backup for wallet recovery—anyone knowing it can access all associated accounts across chains. Do not store it digitally (e.g., screenshots or cloud notes, vulnerable to hacks) or share with anyone, even "support" (phishing scams steal $500 million+ yearly). Private keys (long hexadecimal strings) are for signing transactions; export only if absolutely necessary, and never input on untrusted sites.
2. **Store Securely in a Physical Location**: Write the mnemonic on paper or metal (e.g., steel plates for fire resistance) and store in multiple safe, offline locations (e.g., home safe, bank deposit box). Avoid digital storage unless encrypted with strong passwords (e.g., using hardware like Ledger for cold backups). For private keys, use wallet apps with biometric locks, but backup phrases offline.
3. **Use Hardware Wallets for Added Protection**: Connect a hardware wallet (e.g., Ledger or Trezor) to MetaMask for signing transactions offline—keys never leave the device, reducing online attack risks by 90%. Ideal for large holdings; in AnteX, it supports secure deposits/withdrawals without exposing phrases.
4. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and Biometrics**: On wallet apps and social logins, activate 2FA (e.g., Google Authenticator, not SMS due to SIM swap attacks costing $100 million+). Use biometrics (fingerprint/face ID) for app access. For AnteX social logins, secure your provider account with strong, unique passwords.
5. **Verify and Double-Check Everything**: Before confirming transactions, verify contract addresses (e.g., AnteX's official USDT testnet: 0x3253a335E7bFfB4790Aa4C25C4250d206E9b9773) on the site to avoid fakes. Use testnet for practice; monitor via explorers for anomalies. Common mistake: Clicking phishing links—always type URLs manually ([https://testnet.antex.ai](https://testnet.antex.ai/)).
6. **Regular Backups and Testing**: Test phrase recovery on a separate device periodically (without real funds). Update wallet software for security patches, and diversify holdings across wallets to limit exposure (e.g., <20% per wallet).

In AnteX use cases, secure your phrase to safely trade perpetuals—losing it means losing access, but AnteX's forced withdrawal can recover locked assets in emergencies. By following these practices, you minimize risks, ensuring a safe DeFi experience on AnteX. If compromised, act fast—change passwords and use recovery tools, but prevention is key.
