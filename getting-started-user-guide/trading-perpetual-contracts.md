# Trading Perpetual Contracts

Trading perpetual contracts on Antex allows you to speculate on asset prices with leverage, using USDT as collateral to open long or short positions without owning the underlying token. This feature mirrors futures but without expiration, supported by Antex's on-chain matching engine for fair executions, native oracle for accurate pricing, and parallel execution for <200ms speedsâ€”enabling high-frequency trading that rivals CeFi like Bybit but with DeFi's transparency and self-custody. Perpetual contracts are ideal for hedging or amplified returns, with funding rates (0.01-0.05% every 8 hours) balancing markets. Unlike spot trading (buying/selling actual assets) or limited-leverage DEXes (e.g., Perpetual Protocol's 10x cap with high slippage), Antex offers up to 100x leverage with <0.1% slippage via ALP depth. Analogous to driving a sports car with adjustable gears (leverage) on a smooth highway (Antex's infrastructure), this lets you accelerate profits but requires monitoring to avoid crashes (liquidations). Quantitative perks: 99% fill rates and positions sized as leverage \* collateral (e.g., $100 at 20x = $2,000 exposure). Always start on testnet, use small collateral, and monitor margins (maintenance 0.5-1%) to prevent auto-liquidations. The following steps guide you, with tips for safe trading.
