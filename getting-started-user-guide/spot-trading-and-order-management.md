# Spot Trading and Order Management

Spot trading on AnteX enables direct buying and selling of digital assets at current market prices, with immediate ownership transfer and on-chain settlement, providing a foundational tool for building and managing crypto portfolios. Unlike perpetual contracts (which involve leveraged speculation without asset ownership), spot trading focuses on actual token exchanges, supported by the on-chain order book for precision, matching engine for fair executions, and ALP for deep liquidity (<0.1% slippage on large orders). This delivers CEX-like efficiency (e.g., <200ms fulfillments) in a decentralized environment, contrasting with AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap (limited to pool swaps with 5-10% slippage and impermanent loss) or CeFi platforms (e.g., Coinbase, with custodial requirements and hidden fees). AnteX's spot trading supports mainstream pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/SOL) with advanced management tools, integrated with native oracles for accurate pricing and parallel execution for handling 10,000+ orders per block. Analogous to managing a personal inventory in a vast, transparent warehouse where you can buy, sell, and organize items effortlessly, this feature allows for strategic trading with real-time oversight. Quantitative advantages: 99% fill rates, fees at 0.02%, and portfolio tracking with <100ms updates. Start on testnet with small trades, use order types wisely, and monitor via dashboard to avoid common pitfalls like overexposure. The following steps guide you, with tips for effective management.

1. **Select Pair and View Market**: From the dashboard ([https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future](https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future) or spot tab), choose your trading pair (e.g., ETH/USDT) using the selector. View real-time charts, order book depth, and oracle-fed prices to inform decisions—e.g., check BTC/USDT for buy opportunities during dips.
2. **Choose Order Type and Enter Details**: Select from market (instant at best price for quick buys), limit (buy/sell at specified price for precision), stop-loss (auto-sell if price drops to limit losses), take-profit (auto-sell at profit target), OCO (pair stop-loss with take-profit), trailing stop (dynamic adjustment, e.g., trail 3% below peaks), or iceberg (hide large orders to minimize impact). Input amount, price (if applicable), and review estimated cost/slippage. For example, place a limit buy for 1 ETH at $2,000 with stop-loss at $1,900.
3. **Place and Confirm Order**: Click "Place Order" and confirm the gas-free or low-gas transaction in your wallet—matched via the engine with <100ms latency.
4. **Manage Open Orders and Positions**: In the "Open Orders" tab, view, edit, or cancel pending orders (e.g., adjust limit price if market shifts). Use the portfolio tracker for real-time P/L, exposure analysis (e.g., max drawdown), and history exports. Set alerts for price thresholds via app notifications.

In use cases, a trader buys SOL with USDT using a market order during a rally, then manages by adding a trailing stop to lock gains as prices rise; or an institution executes a $1M ETH swap with iceberg orders to avoid market impact, monitoring via API for automated adjustments. Tip: Diversify pairs to hedge risks, use stop-loss for all positions to cap losses (e.g., 5-10% below entry), and review order history for tax reporting—AnteX's on-chain verifiability simplifies audits. Common mistake: Placing large market orders without checking depth—use limit/iceberg for control, especially in volatile markets. With multi-device support (web/app/API), manage on the go, integrating with multi-chain deposits for seamless asset inflow. This makes spot trading intuitive and powerful on AnteX, complementing perpetuals for a complete DeFi experience.
