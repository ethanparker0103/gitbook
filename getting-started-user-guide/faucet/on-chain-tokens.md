# On-chain Tokens

You can get tokens by following these steps:

## **Prepare gas**

Make sure you have some native tokens (e.g. ETH, etc.) in your wallet to pay for gas fees.

You can claim free testnet ETH from [Alchemyâ€™s Arbitrum Sepolia Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/arbitrum-sepolia).

## **Request tokens**

Click the **claim** button and confirm the transaction in your wallet. The tokens will be minted and sent after the transaction is completed.

## **Deposit to exchange**

Once the tokens arrive in your wallet, use the standard **Deposit** feature to transfer them into your account.



**Rules**&#x20;

* Each deposit is limited to a maximum of **2000 U**.
* There is no limit on the number of deposits.
