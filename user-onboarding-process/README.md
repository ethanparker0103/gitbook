# How to onboard to Antex？

## **Quick overview — which way to choose**

* **DeFi wallet (recommended if you already use MetaMask/Phantom/etc.)** — you keep your own keys and can use any supported wallet extension or mobile wallet app.
  * **Prereq:** browser wallet extension / mobile wallet app installed.
* **Email login (convenient for non-wallet users)** — sign in with email; Antex (via a third-party provider such as Privy) will create/assign a blockchain address for that email so you can deposit and trade.
