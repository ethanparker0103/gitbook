# Advanced Onboarding for Institutions and Developers

Antex's advanced onboarding caters to institutions and developers seeking deeper integration and customization, building on the basic process with tools for high-volume trading, API-driven automation, dApp deployment, and ecosystem contributions. This streamlined path leverages Antex's EVM compatibility, native APIs, and governance features, enabling institutions to manage large portfolios securely and developers to build/launch apps in hours—contrasting with rigid CeFi setups (e.g., Binance's API requiring KYC and limits on volume) or developer-unfriendly chains (e.g., Solana's Rust learning curve delaying deployments by weeks). With quantitative efficiency: institutions onboard in <10 minutes with 99% uptime for API calls, while developers deploy dApps in <5 minutes at 50% lower costs than Ethereum. Analogous to a VIP entrance with backstage access to a concert (Antex ecosystem), this process provides privileged tools like priority support and grants, fostering innovation and institutional adoption. Prerequisites: Basic wallet connection (as in earlier subsections); contact [support@antex.ai](mailto:support@antex.ai) for tailored assistance. The following outlines steps, resources, and use cases.

1. **Institutional Onboarding**: Institutions start by connecting a multi-signature or enterprise wallet (e.g., Gnosis Safe for team approvals), verifying via a gas-free signature. Request API keys from the dashboard (REST/WebSocket with 1,000+ requests/second limits, customizable for HFT). Set up custom dashboards for portfolio monitoring (e.g., real-time P/L across perpetuals/spot with oracle data). Deposit large volumes (e.g., $1M USDT via cross-chain from Ethereum) with dedicated support for compliance (optional KYC integration for regulated entities). Enable advanced features like bulk orders or ALP provisions with locked incentives (e.g., 10% bonus yields for $10M+ deposits).
2. **Developer Onboarding**: Developers connect a wallet and access the SDK/CLI tools from the dev portal (docs.antex.ai), including EVM libraries for Solidity. Deploy contracts via testnet (e.g., remix.ethereum.org integrated with Antex RPC), testing integrations like calling the matching engine for custom perpetuals. Apply for grants (up to $50,000 from treasury) via governance proposals for projects like lending dApps.

Use cases: An institution onboards with API for algorithmic trading, executing 500 perpetual orders/minute at <0.1% slippage, managing $100M portfolios with verifiability—saving 60% on costs vs. CeFi. A developer deploys an options app integrating ALP collateral, launching in 2 hours with oracle feeds for strike prices, attracting 1,000 users and $5M TVL in weeks.

Resources: Dedicated Discord channels for devs/institutions (response <1 hour), advanced videos (e.g., "API Integration for HFT"), and FAQs (e.g., "How to deploy a lending dApp?"). Challenges like API rate limits are solved with tiered keys (up to 10,000 requests/second for verified entities). This advanced onboarding accelerates value creation, with Antex's ecosystem supporting $500M+ in developer-driven TVL. For more, join the dev community or email for partnerships.
