# Tutorial Resources (Videos, FAQs, and Community Support)

Antex provides a rich array of tutorial resources to facilitate smooth onboarding and ongoing learning, ensuring users of all levels can navigate the platform confidently. These materials are accessible directly from the dashboard or official site ([https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future](https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future)), reducing the learning curve by 70% based on beta feedback (e.g., users mastering perpetual trading in <10 minutes vs. 30+ on other DEXes like Uniswap). This contrasts with sparse resources on many platforms (e.g., basic FAQs on dYdX without video support), offering videos for visual guidance, FAQs for quick answers, and community channels for personalized help. Analogous to a well-stocked library with librarians (community) and audiovisual aids (videos), these resources empower self-paced education while fostering a supportive ecosystem. Quantitative impact: Over 20,000 video views and 5,000+ FAQ accesses in beta, with 90% user satisfaction. Resources are updated regularly via governance, integrating with Antex's multi-device support for on-the-go access. If you're stuck, start with videos, check FAQs, then reach community—most issues resolved in <5 minutes.

Videos are hosted on YouTube and the Antex site, with short, step-by-step guides (2-5 minutes) covering topics like "Wallet Connection and First Deposit" (10,000+ views, demonstrating MetaMask setup and USDT deposit in <1 minute) or "Trading Perpetual Contracts" (explaining leverage sliders and order confirmation with screen shares). Advanced videos include "Managing Spot Orders with Stop-Loss" (5,000 views, showing order types in action) and "Cross-Chain Deposits Tutorial" (detailing transfers from Solana to Antex with verifiability tips). All videos feature subtitles, timestamps, and links to related FAQs, with a playlist for complete onboarding (total 20 minutes). In use cases, a beginner watches the "First Trade" video to place a test perpetual long on BTC, gaining confidence without risk.

FAQs are comprehensive, searchable on the site, addressing 100+ common questions with detailed answers. Examples:

* "How do I connect my wallet?": Step-by-step with screenshots for MetaMask/social login, noting testnet addition.
* "What is leverage in perpetuals?": Explains calculation (leverage \* collateral = position size) with examples (e.g., $100 at 10x = $1,000 exposure) and risk warnings.
* "Why is my deposit delayed?": Covers network congestion solutions (use L2 like Arbitrum) and verification checks.
* "How secure is social login?": Details OAuth/2FA protections and recommendation to pair with hardware wallets.

Community support is vibrant via Discord (5,000+ members), Telegram (3,000+), and forums, with 24/7 moderation and response times <5 minutes (90% queries resolved in first reply). Official channels offer live AMAs, troubleshooting threads (e.g., "Wallet Connection Issues"), and expert advice from team/Antex ambassadors. In use cases, a user posts about a deposit error on Discord, receiving step-by-step help with screenshots, resolving in 3 minutes. Quantitative: 80% of support tickets closed within 10 minutes, with community-driven wikis enhancing resources. For developers, dedicated channels provide API docs and bug bounties.

These resources ensure a supportive onboarding, minimizing errors and maximizing Antex's potential—dive in and join the community for ongoing learning!
