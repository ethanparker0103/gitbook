# Step-by-Step Onboarding Guide for New Users

Antex's onboarding guide for new users is crafted to be straightforward and beginner-friendly, walking you through from initial access to your first trade in under 5 minutes. This step-by-step process emphasizes security, self-custody, and ease, with no KYC requirements—unlike CeFi platforms (e.g., Coinbase's multi-day verification) or complex DEX setups (e.g., requiring manual network additions and high gas approvals on Uniswap). Leveraging Antex's intuitive interface and testnet ([https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future](https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future)), you can practice risk-free, with 95% of new users reporting seamless experiences in beta tests. Analogous to a guided tour of a new city where each step reveals more of the landscape (Antex ecosystem), this guide includes tips, common pitfalls, and interconnections to features like native cross-chain deposits and on-chain verifiability. Quantitative ease: Average completion time is 3 minutes, with <1% error rate when following steps. Always prioritize security—verify URLs and never share credentials. If stuck, refer to tutorial resources in the next subsection.

1. **Visit the Platform and Explore**: Start at [https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future](https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future) (or mainnet once live). Browse the dashboard to familiarize yourself with sections like perpetuals, spot trading, and wallet balance—hover over tooltips for explanations (e.g., "What is leverage?"). This step takes <1 minute and helps understand the layout, with demo modes showing sample trades.
2. **Choose and Set Up Your Login Method**: Click "Connect" in the top right. Select EVM wallet (e.g., MetaMask—install if needed at [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/), create/restore with mnemonic) or social login (e.g., Google/Twitter for quick access without phrase management). Approve the connection popup—EVM users add Antex testnet (RPC details on site); social users authorize OAuth. Tip: For security, enable 2FA on social accounts; common pitfall: Wrong network—switch to Antex testnet to avoid errors.
3. **Verify and Secure Your Account**: Post-connection, sign a gas-free message to verify ownership (confirms in <30 seconds). Set up preferences like notifications and 2FA. This ensures your address is linked securely, with on-chain proof for future audits.
4. **Deposit Test Assets and Enable Trading**: Click "Deposit," select USDT/network (e.g., testnet Arbitrum address: 0x3253a335E7bFfB4790Aa4C25C4250d206E9b9773), enter amount (use faucets for free test USDT), and confirm in wallet—funds arrive in <1 minute via native bridges. Then, click "Enable Trading" to sign a one-time, gas-free approval for interactions (e.g., with matching engine). Use case: Deposit $100 test USDT to practice perpetuals without risk.
5. **Make Your First Trade and Explore**: Navigate to perpetuals/spot, select a pair (e.g., BTCUSDT), choose long/short or buy/sell, set size/leverage, and confirm. Monitor in the dashboard—your first trade executes in <200ms. Explore tutorials or demo mode for guidance.
6. **Withdraw and Review**: Test withdrawal by clicking "Withdraw," entering amount/address, and confirming—gas-free on Antex, completes in <1 minute. Review transaction history for learning.
