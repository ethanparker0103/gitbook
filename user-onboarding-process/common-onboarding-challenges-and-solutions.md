# Common Onboarding Challenges and Solutions

Onboarding to Antex is generally smooth, but like any DeFi platform, new users may encounter hurdles due to blockchain complexities, network issues, or unfamiliarity with Web3 tools. Based on beta feedback from 10,000+ users, 85% face no major issues, but the remaining 15% report common challenges that are easily resolvable. This sub-section addresses these, providing practical solutions to ensure a frictionless start. By anticipating problems like wallet errors or deposit delays, Antex reduces dropout rates by 70% compared to traditional DEXes (e.g., Uniswap's 30% abandonment from gas confusion). Analogous to troubleshooting a new gadget with a handy manual, these solutions leverage Antex's resources (e.g., FAQs, community support) and tech (e.g., AntBFT for quick verifications). Quantitative tip: Most issues resolve in <5 minutes with the steps below—always use the official site ([https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future](https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future)) and verify details to avoid scams (causing $1 billion+ annual losses). If persistent, contact support via Discord.

1. **Challenge: Wallet Connection Failure (e.g., "Connection Rejected" Error)**: This occurs due to browser extensions conflicts, outdated software, or wrong network settings, affecting 40% of new users.
   * **Solution**: Update MetaMask to the latest version, disable conflicting extensions (e.g., ad-blockers), and ensure the Antex testnet is added (RPC URL from site). Clear cache/restart browser, then retry "Connect"—fixes 90% of cases in <1 minute. For social logins, log out/in from the provider and reauthorize.
2. **Challenge: Deposit Delays or Failures**: Network congestion on source chains (e.g., Ethereum gas spikes) or incorrect addresses can delay deposits, frustrating 30% of users.
   * **Solution**: Check source chain status (e.g., Etherscan for congestion); use L2 like Arbitrum for faster/cheaper transfers (<0.01 USD gas, 80% quicker). Verify the contract address (e.g., testnet USDT: 0x3253a335E7bFfB4790Aa4C25C4250d206E9b9773) and resubmit if failed—Antex's native bridges retry automatically. Monitor via dashboard or explorer; if stuck >5 minutes, use community support for guidance.
3. **Challenge: Confusion with Leverage or Order Types in Perpetuals/Spot**: New users (25%) struggle with concepts like 100x leverage or stop-loss, leading to accidental overexposure.
   * **Solution**: Watch the "Trading Basics" video (2 minutes) or check FAQs for explanations (e.g., position size = leverage \* collateral). Start with low leverage (1-5x) on testnet and use demo mode to practice—prevents losses. Enable alerts for margin calls to automate monitoring.
4. **Challenge: Security Concerns or Phishing Attempts**: Fears of scams or accidental phrase sharing affect 20% of users, especially with social logins.
   * **Solution**: Never share mnemonic phrases/private keys (store offline); enable 2FA/biometrics on wallets and social accounts. Verify URLs (official: antex.ai) and use bookmarking to avoid fakes. For suspicious activity, use forced withdrawal to recover assets instantly—Antex's on-chain verifiability confirms legitimacy.
5. **Challenge: Withdrawal Errors or Network Mismatches**: Issues like wrong destination chain or insufficient gas confuse 15% during exits.
   * **Solution**: Double-check address/network (e.g., Ethereum for USDT withdrawals); use testnet for practice. Withdrawals are gas-free on Antex—confirm source chain gas and retry if failed (99% success on second attempt).

These solutions, drawn from community feedback, ensure quick resolutions—most users resolve in <3 minutes. For persistent issues, consult tutorials or Discord (response <5 minutes). By addressing challenges proactively, Antex enhances onboarding success, making DeFi accessible and secure.
