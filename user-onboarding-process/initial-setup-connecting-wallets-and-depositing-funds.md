# Initial Setup: Connecting Wallets and Depositing Funds

The initial setup on Antex focuses on connecting your wallet and depositing funds, serving as the gateway to trading while upholding self-custody—your assets remain in your control throughout. This process is optimized for speed and security, taking under 2 minutes for 90% of users in beta tests, with native cross-chain support ensuring seamless deposits from various networks. Unlike cumbersome setups on other DEXes (e.g., multiple approvals and high gas on Ethereum, averaging 5-10 minutes and $5-20 fees) or CeFi's invasive deposits (e.g., Binance requiring KYC and asset handover with 1-2 day waits), Antex's method is gas-efficient and user-centric, leveraging AntBFT for instant verifications and parallel execution for quick processing. Analogous to plugging in a device and transferring data without handing over ownership, this setup empowers you to fund perpetuals or spot trades immediately. Quantitative ease: Deposits complete in <1 minute with 99% success rates on testnet, no minimum on practice mode. Always use the official site ([https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future](https://testnet.antex.ai/en/future)) and verify addresses to avoid scams. The steps below detail the process, with tips for smooth execution.

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: After account creation (as in the previous subsection), click "Connect" on the dashboard. For EVM wallets like MetaMask, select it from the list and approve the popup (adds Antex testnet automatically if not configured—RPC details on site). For social login, choose your provider (e.g., Google) and authorize—generates an address instantly. This links your wallet non-custodially, with <30 seconds confirmation via on-chain signature.
2. **Prepare for Deposit**: Ensure you have USDT in your wallet on a supported network (e.g., testnet Arbitrum address: 0x3253a335E7bFfB4790Aa4C25C4250d206E9b9773; use faucets for free test tokens on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, or TRON). Click "Deposit" in the wallet section—select USDT and source network.
3. **Enter Deposit Details**: Input the amount (e.g., $100 test USDT; no min on testnet, but $10 suggested for practice). Review estimated time (<1 minute via native bridges) and any source-chain gas (negligible on L2 like Arbitrum, <0.01 USD).
4. **Confirm and Execute**: Click "Deposit" and sign the transaction in your wallet popup—Antex's protocols handle the cross-chain transfer atomically, with funds appearing in your balance for trading. No gas on Antex side, ensuring cost-free entry.
5. **Enable Trading**: Post-deposit, click "Enable Trading" to sign a one-time, gas-free approval, authorizing interactions with the matching engine and order book—essential for placing trades, completed in <10 seconds.

In use cases, connect MetaMask, deposit test USDT from BNB Chain, enable trading, and open a perpetual position—all in 3 minutes for a beginner practicing longs/shorts. An advanced user deposits from Solana for spot trading, using API for automation. Tip: Start with small amounts on testnet to test flows; common pitfall: Wrong network—switch in wallet to avoid failed transactions (affects 10% of new users). For security, use hardware wallets for deposits and enable notifications for confirmation alerts. This setup integrates with Antex's ecosystem, readying you for perpetuals or spot trading with full verifiability. If delays occur (rare, <1%), check chain explorers or support.
