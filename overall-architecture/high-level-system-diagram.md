# High-Level System Diagram

The high-level system diagram of Antex presents a layered, modular architecture that visualizes the blockchain as a stacked pyramid, with each layer building upon the last to form a cohesive, high-performance L1 infrastructure. At the base is the foundational Data Layer, represented as a solid blue rectangle symbolizing persistent storage (e.g., Merkle trees and key-value databases), annotated with metrics like "1TB optimized storage for 1-year history" and "efficient state queries <10ms." Arrows from this layer point upward, indicating data flows to higher levels, emphasizing immutability and integration with on-chain components like the order book.

Above it is the Network Layer, depicted as a green interconnected web of nodes (circles representing validators, connected by dashed lines for P2P gossip protocols), with labels such as "BLS-optimized communication for 10,000+ nodes" and "low bandwidth: 100 Mbps per node." Horizontal extensions show cross-chain bridges as bidirectional arrows linking to external ecosystems (e.g., icons for Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and TRON), annotated with "atomic transfers <500ms" to highlight interoperability without third-party risks.

The central Consensus Layer is illustrated as a yellow circle with rotating gears (symbolizing AntBFT's leader rotation), enclosing sub-elements like BLS aggregation and two-chain commits. Annotations include "millisecond finality (200-500ms)" and "fault tolerance: 33% malicious nodes," with vertical arrows showing input from the Network Layer (quorum votes) and output to the Execution Layer (validated blocks). This layer is visually central, underscoring its role in orchestrating the system.

Next is the Execution Layer, shown as an orange multi-core processor icon with parallel arrows representing concurrent processing, labeled "parallel execution engine: 10,000+ TPS" and "optimistic rollback <1ms." It connects downward to the Data Layer for state reads/writes and upward to the Contract Layer, illustrating how non-conflicting transactions (e.g., icons for trades and transfers) are scheduled across cores.

The Contract Layer is portrayed as a purple code block with EVM icons (e.g., Solidity snippets), integrating protocol components like the on-chain order book (a ledger icon), matching engine (gears), and native oracle (data feed arrows). Annotations note "EVM compatibility: deploy existing dApps in minutes" and "gas optimizations: 50% lower than Ethereum," with flows showing oracle prices feeding into matching logic.

At the top is the Application Layer, depicted as user-facing interfaces (e.g., web/app/API icons with trading dashboards), connected to the Contract Layer via API calls. It includes elements like social logins and real-time verification tools, annotated with "CEX-like UX: <0.1% slippage via ALP."

Cross-cutting elements include security overlays (red shields for PoS staking/slashing across all layers) and performance flows (green arrows showing data from bottom to top, e.g., a perpetual trade path: Application → Contract → Execution → Consensus → Network → Data). Feedback loops (circular arrows) highlight oracle aggregation returning to validators. Quantitative summaries are boxed at the bottom: "Overall: 99.99% uptime, 10,000+ TPS, Ethereum-level security."

This diagram contrasts with Ethereum's flatter architecture (prone to congestion) by emphasizing modularity and integration, reducing attack surfaces (e.g., no external oracles). In DeFi use cases, it shows how a cross-chain trade flows through layers for seamless execution, illustrating Antex's efficiency in unifying liquidity and enabling real-time trading.
