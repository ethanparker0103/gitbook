# Abstract

## Overview of Antex's Vision and Core Innovations

Antex is a sovereign Layer 1 (L1) blockchain infrastructure purpose-built for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, designed to revolutionize digital asset trading by combining the performance and user experience of centralized exchanges (CEX) with the inherent security, transparency, and self-custody of blockchain technology. At its core, Antex leverages an optimized HotStuff-based consensus algorithm (AntBFT) and a parallel execution engine to achieve high throughput, low latency, and scalability, supporting thousands of transactions per second (TPS) while maintaining Ethereum-level security.

Key innovations include a fully on-chain order book for limit and advanced orders, an on-chain matching engine for fair and verifiable trade execution, and a native decentralized oracle network that aggregates price data from multiple sources to prevent manipulation. These components are deeply integrated into the protocol layer, eliminating reliance on off-chain elements and enabling seamless perpetual contracts, spot trading, and cross-chain asset transfers. Antex is EVM-compatible, allowing developers to deploy existing smart contracts and dApps with minimal friction, while its Antex Liquidity Pool (ALP) aggregates multi-asset liquidity to minimize slippage and reward providers. Built with security as the paramount principle, Antex ensures true user self-custody—assets remain in personal wallets, verifiable in real-time, and protected by mechanisms like forced withdrawals in emergencies.

## Key Problems Solved and Value Proposition

The current DeFi landscape faces a trilemma: CEX platforms offer superior performance but expose users to custodial risks and opacity, as seen in collapses like FTX; traditional DEXes on general-purpose chains suffer from low TPS, high gas fees, impermanent loss in AMM models, and liquidity fragmentation across isolated blockchains; while Layer 2 solutions provide partial relief, they often introduce new centralization risks and fail to unify cross-chain assets.

Antex addresses these challenges head-on by creating an independent L1 optimized for finance, delivering CEX-like experiences (e.g., millisecond order execution, deep liquidity, and intuitive interfaces) in a fully decentralized environment. It breaks down liquidity silos with native omnichain support for major networks like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and TRON, enabling seamless asset transfers without third-party bridges. Users benefit from ultra-low fees, transparent fee distribution (rewarding stakers, liquidity providers, and the community), and institutional-grade tools, all while retaining full control over their funds.

Our vision is to foster a user-owned global financial market that is secure, open, and fair in the Web3 era. By empowering traders, developers, and liquidity providers with a platform that prioritizes autonomy and efficiency, Antex lays the foundation for the next generation of DeFi—where innovation thrives without compromising trust. Whether for high-frequency trading, passive income via ALP, or building ecosystem apps, Antex delivers unmatched value: a truly self-custodial, high-performance DEX that redefines decentralized finance for all.
