# ðŸ‘‹ About Antex

## **What is Antex?**

Antex is an independent Layer 1 financial blockchain that leverages optimized Hot-Stuff consensus & parallel processing technology. It features an on-chain order book, on-chain matching, and decentralized oracle price feeds to create a fully on-chain decentralized finance platform. With security as the top priority, Antex enables decentralized governance for trading any asset, delivering a completely secure and transparent next-generation fully on-chain DeFi platform.

#### Technical overview <a href="#technical-overview" id="technical-overview"></a>

**Antexâ€‹**â€‹ is a newly built and optimized Layer 1 blockchain (L1) specifically designed for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

After analyzing various existing models in both centralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), we prioritized the needs of decentralized financial platforms and user experience, with security as the foundational principle. This led to a complete redesign of Antexâ€™s technical architecture, which includes the following key components:

#### â€‹**â€‹Consensus Algorithmâ€‹**â€‹

The network employs a custom consensus algorithm called â€‹**â€‹AntBFTâ€‹**â€‹, which is built upon an optimized and restructured version of â€‹**â€‹HotStuffâ€‹**â€‹ to support high-performance consensus across large-scale nodes and enable rapid transaction finality. Both the algorithm and network infrastructure have been re-engineered from the ground up to meet the unique demands of an L1 blockchain.

#### â€‹**â€‹Parallel Executionâ€‹**â€‹

To ensure fast transaction processing, the network utilizes â€‹**â€‹parallel computing technologyâ€‹**â€‹, allowing different transactions to be categorized and executed concurrently at the logic layer. This significantly enhances the networkâ€™s overall throughput.

#### â€‹**â€‹Security-First Approachâ€‹**â€‹

To achieve â€‹**â€‹true self-custodyâ€‹**â€‹ of user assets and ensure â€‹**â€‹Ethereum-level securityâ€‹**â€‹, the network implements a fully decentralized security mechanism for assets and transactions. All transactions can be verified in real time, and users retain full control over their assetsâ€”the network itself cannot perform any risky operations on user funds.

#### â€‹**â€‹EVM Compatibilityâ€‹**â€‹

To ensure seamless integration with the broader decentralized ecosystem, Antex is fully â€‹**â€‹EVM-compatibleâ€‹**â€‹, enabling developers to deploy existing smart contracts and dApps with minimal friction while leveraging Antexâ€™s high-performance infrastructure.
