# True Self-Custody of User Assets

True self-custody is a defining advantage of Antex, ensuring that users maintain absolute, uninterrupted control over their assets at all times, without ever relinquishing them to the platform or network. All funds reside in personal EVM-compatible wallets (e.g., MetaMask or WalletConnect), with every transaction requiring explicit private key signatures from the user—preventing any unauthorized access or interference by the system. This model is fundamentally non-custodial, meaning the network is architecturally incapable of performing risk operations on user funds, such as freezing, seizing, or reallocating assets, even in edge cases. In contrast to CeFi platforms like Celsius or Voyager, where users "deposit" assets into centralized vaults leading to $4 billion+ in inaccessible funds during 2022 bankruptcies due to mismanagement, Antex eliminates such vulnerabilities by design. Even in DeFi, models with pseudo-custody (e.g., wrapped tokens on bridges like Wrapped BTC, exposed to $1 billion+ in exploits from custodian failures), introduce indirect risks; Antex avoids this entirely, with protocol rules enforcing user sovereignty.

Quantitative benefits underscore this strength: asset access remains instantaneous (<100ms for wallet interactions), with zero recorded custody-related losses in simulations, reducing overall exposure to theft or mismanagement by 90% compared to custodial systems. The entire codebase—for the matching engine, oracle, order book, and more—is fully open-source, hosted on platforms like GitHub with 100% test coverage, allowing developers and users to audit for backdoors or flaws, promoting community-driven improvements and transparency. Analogous to owning the only key to a personal vault while the bank (network) provides secure infrastructure without entry rights, this ensures users are the sole arbiters of their funds. The forced withdrawal protocol further reinforces this: in emergencies (e.g., platform outage or suspected malice), users can invoke an on-chain function to directly extract assets to another address or chain in under 1 minute, bypassing any compromised layers and integrated with AntBFT consensus for verifiable execution.

In real-world DeFi use cases, a trader collateralizes a perpetual contract with USDT directly from their wallet, retaining full control during high-leverage trades (e.g., 100x on ETH), with on-chain verifiability confirming no unauthorized deductions—avoiding scenarios like FTX's sudden asset locks that trapped $8 billion. Institutions manage treasury provisions in ALP without handing over keys, using multi-signature setups for added layers of approval, while retail users execute spot trades via social logins tied to self-custodial addresses, benefiting from parallel execution for efficient processing without custody handoffs. Tied to Antex's BFT fault tolerance (up to 33% malicious nodes) and slashing mechanisms (e.g., 100% penalties for attempted interference), this true self-custody mitigates the $2 billion+ annual losses from custody breaches across the industry, empowering users in a trustless ecosystem where financial autonomy is paramount and verifiable at every step.
