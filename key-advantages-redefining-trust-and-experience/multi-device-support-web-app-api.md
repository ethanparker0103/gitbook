# Multi-Device Support (Web, App, API)

Antex provides comprehensive multi-device support through professional-grade interfaces, ensuring traders can access the platform anytime, anywhere, across web, mobile app, and APIâ€”meeting diverse needs from casual users to algorithmic bots. The web interface offers a sleek, customizable dashboard with real-time charts, order books, and analytics, while the mobile app (iOS/Android) includes push notifications for price alerts and one-tap trades, with social logins for quick access. The API (REST/WebSocket) supports high-throughput integrations (e.g., 1,000 requests/second with <1ms latency), enabling custom bots and institutional tools.

This contrasts with limited DEX interfaces (e.g., Uniswap's web-only focus with poor mobile optimization) or CeFi apps (restricted by geoblocking). Quantitative edges include 95% user satisfaction in beta tests and cross-device sync in <100ms. In use cases, a retail trader monitors perpetual positions via app notifications on mobile, while a hedge fund uses API for automated arbitrage across ETH/SOL pairs, executing 500 trades/minute. Integrated with EVM wallets and AntBFT for secure sessions, this support ensures a frictionless, all-encompassing experience, democratizing advanced trading in DeFi.
