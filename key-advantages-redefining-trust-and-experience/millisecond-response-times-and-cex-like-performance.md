# Millisecond Response Times and CEX-Like Performance

Antex's trading infrastructure is optimized for millisecond response times, delivering performance that matches or exceeds leading CEXes like Bybit or OKX, but in a fully decentralized manner. Orders are placed, matched, and confirmed in under 200ms, thanks to parallel execution classifying non-conflicting transactions for concurrent processing and AntBFT consensus providing instant finality (200-500ms vs. Ethereum's 12-60 seconds). This enables CEX-like fluidity: for example, opening a perpetual position or executing a spot trade feels instantaneous, with no waiting for block confirmations during volatility. Quantitative metrics highlight superiority: throughput of 10,000+ TPS supports high-frequency trading (e.g., 1,000 orders/second per user), with latency 5-10x lower than L2 solutions like Optimism (1-2 seconds during peaks). In comparative terms, while Uniswap suffers from gas wars (fees spiking to $50+), Antex maintains <0.01 USD costs and consistent speeds, reducing opportunity losses by 70% in fast markets.

In DeFi use cases, a day trader scalps BTC/USDT with limit orders, benefiting from real-time matching and oracle updates for precise entries/exits, achieving 15-20% daily returns without slippage delays. Institutions execute large block trades ($10M+) with minimal market impact, using iceberg orders processed in parallel. Tied to the native oracle for accurate pricing and ALP for depth, this performance redefines DeFi trading as smooth and responsive as CeFi, but with on-chain verifiability and no KYC barriers.
