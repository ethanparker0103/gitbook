# Security and Transparency

Security and transparency are the foundational advantages of Antex, addressing the industry's most pressing issues of trust and accountability. By prioritizing a "security-first" architecture with fully decentralized mechanisms, Antex ensures all assets and transactions are protected and verifiable, eliminating the opacity that led to CeFi disasters like FTX's $8 billion collapse in 2022 (due to hidden mismanagement) and DeFi vulnerabilities like $3 billion+ in 2022 hacks from smart contract exploits. Antex achieves this through PoS with high economic stakes, BFT fault tolerance, and on-chain proofs, providing Ethereum-level robustness while enabling true self-custody. Analogous to a glass-walled fortress where every action is visible and every wall is reinforced, this approach fosters unwavering trust, with quantitative benefits like 99.99% uptime and <50ms verification times. Integrated with AntBFT consensus for deterministic finality and parallel execution for efficient processing, it supports real-time audits, reducing fraud risks by 95% compared to non-transparent systems. In DeFi use cases, traders verify perpetual contract liquidations instantly, ensuring fairness without relying on third parties.

**Ethereum-Level Security and Full Verifiability**

Antex delivers security on par with Ethereum through a robust PoS model backed by decentralized validators (using AVS for enhanced monitoring) and a high economic security budget (e.g., $10 billion+ in staked ANTEX equivalent), deterring attacks like 51% takeovers that would cost attackers exponentially more than gains. BFT mechanisms tolerate up to 33% faulty or malicious nodes, ensuring network liveness even in adversarial conditions—surpassing Ethereum's post-merge PoS (with occasional reorgs) by providing millisecond finality via AntBFT. All transactions and asset movements are fully verifiable: on-chain proofs (e.g., Merkle trees and zero-knowledge succinct arguments) allow light clients to audit details like order matches or oracle feeds in <50ms, with complete transaction histories publicly accessible via block explorers.

This verifiability contrasts with CeFi's black-box operations (e.g., Coinbase's undisclosed reserves leading to user distrust) and partial transparency in DEXes like Uniswap (where pool states are verifiable but not real-time trades). Quantitative edges include a mean time to failure (MTTF) exceeding 10 years in simulations, with slashing penalties (up to 100% of stakes for double-signing) aligning incentives. In use cases, a user audits a spot trade's execution against the order book, confirming no front-running (saving $500 million+ annual losses from MEV on Ethereum), while institutions verify ALP distributions for compliance reporting.

**True Self-Custody of User Assets**

Antex ensures true self-custody by keeping all assets in user-controlled EVM wallets, with no network or platform access—preventing unilateral actions like asset freezing seen in CeFi (e.g., $4 billion locked in Celsius's 2022 bankruptcy). Transactions require private key signatures, and the protocol is designed so the network cannot perform any risk operations on user funds (e.g., no forced transfers or hidden fees). Code for all logic, including the matching engine and oracle, is open-source, allowing community audits and contributing to extreme transparency—unlike proprietary CeFi code that hides vulnerabilities.

This model empowers users with full control, integrated with forced withdrawal protocols for emergencies (e.g., direct extraction in <1 minute if the frontend fails). Quantitative benefits include zero custody-related losses (vs. $2 billion+ in CeFi hacks) and 100% user sovereignty. In use cases, a trader holds USDT collateral for perpetuals in their wallet, verifying balances on-chain during trades, while DAOs manage treasury assets without intermediary risks. Compared to pseudo-custody in some DEXes (e.g., wrapped assets on bridges with hidden fees), Antex's approach reduces exposure by 90%, fostering a trustless environment where users truly own their financial future.
