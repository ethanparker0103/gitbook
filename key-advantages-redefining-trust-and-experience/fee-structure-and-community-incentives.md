# Fee Structure and Community Incentives

Antex's fee structure is simple, tiered, and ultra-competitive: spot trades incur 0.02-0.05% (maker/taker model), perpetuals 0.03-0.06% (with rebates for makers), and cross-chain transfers <0.01 USD flatâ€”80% lower than Ethereum DEX averages (0.3% + gas) and transparent with no hidden charges. Fees are collected on-chain via the matching engine and automatically distributed through smart contracts in the Contract Layer, governed by ANTEX holders via proposals (e.g., Snapshot voting integrated with AntBFT for secure decisions). Allocations are predefined but adjustable: 40% to LPs in ALP (boosting yields to 10-20% APY), 30% to stakers/validators (rewarding network security), 20% to the community treasury (funding grants, audits, and development), and 10% burned for deflation (reducing supply by 1-2% annually, similar to BNB's model but decentralized).

This transparent, fair distribution contrasts with opaque CeFi (e.g., FTX's undisclosed fee skimming contributing to collapse) or unequal DEXes (e.g., Curve's veCRV locking favoring whales). Incentives include bonus rebates (0.01% for high-volume makers) and governance rewards (e.g., ANTEX airdrops for proposal participants), encouraging ecosystem contributions like dApp building or liquidity provision. Quantitative outcomes: treasury-funded grants have supported 50+ dApps in beta, with burns contributing to 15% annual token appreciation. In use cases, an LP earns 12% APY from spot fees while staking for extra 5% rewards, creating compounded income; a developer receives treasury grants to build a lending app, integrating ALP for collateral and boosting platform TVL by 20%. Tied to parallel execution for low-cost processing and oracle for accurate fee calculations, this structure ensures fees drive positive growth, making Antex a community-centric platform where every participant benefits equitably.
