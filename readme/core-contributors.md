# Core contributors

Antex Labs is the core contributor driving the development of the Antex ecosystem, with key team members hailing from top-tier exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, OKX, as well as renowned public blockchain teams.

Since entering the crypto space in 2018, the team has built industry-leading CEX and DEX platforms for users while accumulating extensive experience and real-world applications in both DeFi and public blockchain domains.

With a deep understanding of the current trading ecosystem, Antex Labs is committed to creating a fully self-custodial, secure, and decentralized financial platform for users. Since 2024, the team has been conducting technical research and development for Antex.

Finance should be secure, open, and fair—even more so in Web3. Confronting the challenges of both centralized and decentralized platforms, we are starting anew to truly build a financial platform that is ​**​by the users, for the users, and owned by the users​**​.
