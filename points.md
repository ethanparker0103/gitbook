# Points

The points program began on November 1, 2023. 1,000,000 points were distributed weekly to users for 6 months, ending May 1, 2024. Points are meant to reward users who contribute to the protocolâ€™s success.

Affiliates earned 1 point for every 4 points their referred users earned. Points criteria was updated on a recurring basis. Points distributions were based on weekly activity ending Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC. Distributions took place on Thursdays. Points were also distributed for the closed alpha period up through October 31, 2023.

The L1 phase of points began on May 29, 2024 and ended in November 2024. 700,000 points were distributed weekly. Activity from May 1-28, 2024 received a multiplier. Hyperliquid reserves the right to modify previous point distributions under its sole discretion.
